<h1>D-Type Workshop</h1>

<p>In this section you will find a few important documents related to the use of D-Type Engine and some of its more advanced features and functions.</p>

<ul>

<li><p><a href="quality.htm">Step by Step: How to Configure D-Type for the Highest Text Quality</a><br />This guide shows, step by step, how to configure D-Type Engine for the highest text quality and provides several screenshots of the resulting output.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="text.htm">Rendering Great Looking Text With D-Type</a><br />This document explains how to render good looking text with D-Type Standard Engine and D-Type Power Engine. However, the emphasis is on D-Type Power Engine.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="pd_frames.htm">Text Flows and Frames</a><br />This document explains how to retrieve and process Text Flows and Frames that D-Type Engine generates during its text layout operations. Frames allow applications to easily implement cursor movement, text selection and hit testing or, as in this example, calculate the global bounding box of a text line. This document supplements the <em>example_powerdoc_frames</em> example that ships with D-Type Power Engine.</p></li>
