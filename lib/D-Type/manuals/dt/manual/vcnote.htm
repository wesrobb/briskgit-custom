<h1>A special note for MS Visual C++ Users</h1>


<p>If your D-Type application uses relative initialization paths and runs fine when launched from Windows but not when launched within MS Visual C++ Studio itself, it is very likely that your Current Working Directory is not set correctly in MS Visual C++ project settings. Go to Projects -> Settings, select the Debug tab and verify the Working Directory field is set correctly. For example, if your application is located in the Release subdirectory, your Working Directory should be set as illustrated below:</p>

<p class="center">
<img src="../images/msvc.gif" width="577" height="372" alt="MS Visual C++ Working Directory" />
