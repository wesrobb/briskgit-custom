<h1>D-Type Text Layout Extension License</h1>

<p>D-Type Text Layout Extension is an optional extension designed to be used in conjunction with D-Type Font Engine.</p>

<p>Two versions of D-Type Text Layout Extension are available: HarfBuzz-based D-Type Text Layout Extension and ICU-based D-Type Text Layout Extension. Both versions have exactly the same binary interface and feature the same API. As of D-Type vesion 6.0, ICU-based D-Type Text Layout Extension is no longer distibuted (although it is still available to existing D-Type customers upon request).</p>


<h2>HarfBuzz-based D-Type Text Layout Extension</h2>

<p>HarfBuzz-based D-Type Text Layout Extension internally relies on <a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/HarfBuzz">HarfBuzz</a>, an open source OpenType text shaping engine. HarfBuzz is licensed under the so-called "Old MIT" license. For details, see the <a href="license2.htm#hb">HarfBuzz license agreement</a>.</p>


<h2>ICU-based D-Type Text Layout Extension</h2>

<p>ICU-based D-Type Text Layout Extension internally relies on the <a href="http://userguide.icu-project.org/layoutengine">ICU LayoutEngine</a>, which is a component of the ICU (International Components for Unicode). ICU LayoutEngine is covered by the X open source license. The X open source license allows ICU to be incorporated into a wide variety of software projects using the GPL license. Because the X open source license is non-viral, ICU also can be incorporated into non-open source products. For details, see the <a href="license2.htm#icu">ICU license agreement</a>.</p>
