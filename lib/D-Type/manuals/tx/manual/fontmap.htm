<span class="codecomment"># Font and Attribute Mapping Table for Unicode Scripts (Fontmap)
#
# This font and attribute mapping table (aka Fontmap) is used when D-Type
# Text Engine processes Unicode text. The purpose of this table is to
# assign suitable fonts and layout attributes to various Unicode scripts
# and/or characters defined within the Unicode Standard.
#
# The mapping table consists of three pipe separated columns:
#
# * 1st Column - Unicode script or character range
# * 2nd Column - Associated attribute set
# * 3rd Column - Associated font
#
# Each Unicode script or character range may have one or more associated
# attribute sets and fonts. If a Unicode script or character range has more
# than one associated attribute set and/or font, it will have multiple rows
# in the mapping table. Only one attribute set and font combination per row
# can be specified. Attribute sets and fonts are listed in the order of
# importance or preference. When processing the Fontmap, D-Type Text Engine
# reads one row at a time. As soon as the first matching row is found,
# D-Type Text Engine stops processing any subsequent rows.
#
# First Column
#
# Within the first column, the CHARCODE, CHARSPAN or SCRIPTCODE instructions
# specify a character range or Unicode script:
#
# * CHARCODE selects a single Unicode character expressed as an 8-digit
#   hexadecimal codepoint.
#
#   Example: CHARCODE:00000041
#
# * CHARSPAN selects a range of Unicode character expressed as a range of
#   8-digit hexadecimal codepoints.
#
#   Example: CHARSPAN:00000041-0000005A
#
# * SCRIPTCODE selects the Unicode script using a 4 character script code
#   (e.g. latn, cyrl, arab, kana etc). See ISO 15924 Code Lists for a list
#   of available codes. Script code 0000 is a special code which means any
#   script. Fonts associated with this code are usually fallback fonts, i.e.
#   fonts that are used in the absence of a more suitable alternative. For
#   this reason, fonts associated with script code 0000 should be listed at
#   the very end of the mapping table. Ideally, fallback fonts should be
#   large Unicode fonts such as Arial Unicode MS or Code2000 so they can be
#   used to represent as many Unicode characters and scrips as possible.
#
#   Example: SCRIPTCODE:arab
#
# Second Column
#
# Within the second column, the ATTRIBS instruction specifies the associated
# set of layout attributes. This set is a comma separated list of
# keyword/value pairs. Currently two attribute keywords are supported:
#
# * ro (relative orientation)
#
#   The ro attribute keyword corresponds to D-Type Power Engine's
#   pdRelativeOrientation property and D-Type Text Engine's TX_ATTR_ORIENTATION
#   attribute identifier. This attribute allows applications to set the most
#   appropriate relative text orientation (portrait/landscape) and baseline
#   (e.g. default, shifted) when the corresponding Unicode script (or character
#   range) and font are used in horizontal and/or vertical layout.
#
# * ts (text shaping)
#
#   The ts attribute keyword corresponds to D-Type Power Engine's pdTextShaping
#   property and D-Type Text Engine's TX_ATTR_SHAPING attribute identifier. When
#   required, this attribute allows applications to explicitly set the text
#   shaping method for the corresponding Unicode script (or character range) and
#   font. If this attribute is not specified, the shaping method will be set
#   automatically based on the Unicode script.
#
# Example: ATTRIBS:ro=8,ts=10025
#
# Third Column
#
# Within the third column, the associated font can be identified by its
# name or Unique Font Identifier (font_uid). To do so, use one of the
# following four instructions:
#
# * FONTFUID
#
#   To identify the font by its Unique Font Identifier (font_uid). This
#   instruction also performs a basic validity check on the font file and
#   attempts to activate it. As a result, non-accessible, invalid and/or
#   corrupt fonts are skipped.
#
#   Example: FONTFUID:S001R_ARIAL_001A
#
# * FASTFUID
#
#   Same as FONTFUID but noticeably faster since it does not perform any
#   validity check on the font file and does not attempt to activate it.
#   As a result, non-accessible, invalid and/or corrupt fonts are not
#   skipped.
#
#   Example: FASTFUID:S001R_ARIAL_001A
#
# * FONTNAME
#
#   To identify the font by name. This instruction also performs a basic
#   validity check on the font file and attempts to activate it. As a
#   result, non-accessible, invalid and/or corrupt fonts are skipped.
#   This instruction is slower than FONTFUID and FASTFUID since it must
#   access the font file and parse its header to extract the font name.
#
#   Example: FONTNAME:Times New Roman
#
# * FASTNAME
#
#   Same as FONTNAME but does not perform any validity check on the font
#   and does not attempt to activate it. As a result, non-accessible,
#   invalid and/or corrupt fonts are not skipped.
#
#   Example: FASTNAME:Times New Roman
#
# Additional notes:
#
# * It is your responsibility to ensure that the fonts listed in this
#   mapping table have a sufficient number of glyphs to adequately
#   represent all of the Unicode scripts and character ranges they are
#   associated with. Only associate a font with a Unicode script or
#   character range if you are sure it supports that particular script
#   or character range. You can use D-Type Font Viewer to check your
#   font's support for the intended Unicode script or character range.
#
# * For more information on the Unique Font Identifiers (font_uid),
#   see the Configure Initial Font List document.
#
# * For more information on Unicode Scripts and script codes, relative
#   orientation and text shaping, see the manual.
