The Radio Button object is an on/off switch that may be toggled by the user. Radio buttons are similar to check boxes except that when several share the same control name, they are mutually exclusive: when one is switched "on", all others with the same name are switched "off". In other words, multiple radio buttons with the same name represent the same feature (or state).
