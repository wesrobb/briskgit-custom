This objects represents a rich text path. In Power Engine API, a rich text path is an array of text fragments formatted according to the specified parameters and drawn along the edge of a user-defined polygon or shape. Functionally, the Rich Text Path object is similar to the {a href="../objects/130.htm"}Text Path{/a} object but is more complex. This is because a typical rich text path usually consists of many text fragments, while each fragment is formatted using a different set of typographic and layout attributes.
