This objects represents a rich text area. In Power Engine API, a rich text area is an array of text fragments formatted according to the specified parameters and drawn within bounds of an invisible rectangular area. Functionally, the Rich Text Area object is similar to the {a href="../objects/103.htm"}Text Area{/a} object but is more complex. This is because a typical rich text area usually consists of many text fragments, while each fragment is formatted using a different set of typographic and layout attributes.
