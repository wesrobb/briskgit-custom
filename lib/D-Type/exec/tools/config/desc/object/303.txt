The Checkbox object is an on/off switch that may be toggled by the user. Checkboxes are similar to radio buttons with one important difference: Even when several share the same control name, they are not mutually exclusive. In other words, switching one of them to the "on" or "off" state does not have any impact on any other control.

In most cases, however, multiple checkboxes do not share the same control name. In this case one checkbox represent exactly one feature (or state).
