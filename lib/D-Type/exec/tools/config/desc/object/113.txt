This object represents a circle or an ellipse. Circles and ellipses constructed in this way are not true mathematical circles/ellipses but close approximations consisting of four symmetrical Bezier curve segments.

While constructing the circle/ellipse object, an optional shadow and/or outline may be specified.

{strong}Designated Rendering Function:{/strong} pdDrawEllipse (5), pdDrawCircle (5)

Note: Although pdBodyPtr is a key link, it is not mandatory. This means it is possible to construct a circle or an ellipse that has no body, only an outline and/or a shadow.
