This objects represents a rich text design. In Power Engine API, a rich text design is an array of manually positioned text fragments. Functionally, the Rich Text Design object is similar to the {a href="../objects/127.htm"}Text Design{/a} object but is more complex. This is because a typical rich text design usually consists of many text fragments, while each fragment is formatted using a different set of typographic and layout attributes.
