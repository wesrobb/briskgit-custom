This objects represents a rich text arc. In Power Engine API, a rich text arc is an array of text fragments formatted according to the specified parameters and drawn on the edge of an imaginary circle. Functionally, the Rich Text Arc object is similar to the {a href="../objects/102.htm"}Text Arc{/a} object but is more complex. This is because a typical rich text arc usually consists of many text fragments, while each fragment is formatted using a different set of typographic and layout attributes.
