A value consisting of 5 independent bits. Each bit indicates whether a line break is allowed after a certain user-selectble class of characters. This makes it possible to fine tune the behaviour of the text wrapping algorithm (on arbitrary text selections) in order to improve the appearance of text.

{strong}Supported values:{/strong}

Bit 0 - If set, line break is allowed after common punctuation marks (e.g. period, comma, exclamation mark, question mark, colon, semi-colon)
Bit 1 - If set, line break is allowed after other punctuation marks (e.g. middle dot, inverted exclamation mark, inverted question mark)
Bit 2 - If set, line break is allowed after minus/hyphen signs and dashes (e.g. en dash, em dash, horizontal bar)
Bit 3 - If set, line break is allowed after forward or backward slashes
Bit 4 - If set, line break is allowed after other separators (e.g. pipe)
Bit 5 - If set, line break is allowed after closing brackets/parentheses
Bit 6 - If set, line break is allowed after other terminating symbols (e.g. percent, degree, cent sign)

{strong}Sample values:{/strong}

0 = Line break is not allowed after any user-selectable class of characters
1 = Line break is allowed after common punctuation marks
8 = Line break is allowed after  forward or backward slashes
9 = Line break is allowed after common punctuation marks and forward or backward slashes
11 = Line break is allowed after common punctuation marks, other punctuation marks and forward or backward slashes
31 = Line break is allowed after all user-selectable classes of characters
