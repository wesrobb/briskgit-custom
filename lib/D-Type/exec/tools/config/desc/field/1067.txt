An array of Multiple-Master font contributions. The value of each element must be in the 0 - 1024 range, where zero means "no contribution" (or 0% contribution) and 1024 means "full contribution" (or 100% contribution). The number of elements in this array must correspond to the number of base designs in the font. Additionally, the sum of all the elements must equal 1024.

This field is useful only when it refers to a Multiple-Master font. With regular (single-master) fonts, this field has no meaning and is ignored. See D-Type Standard Engine Manual for more information on Multiple-Master fonts.
