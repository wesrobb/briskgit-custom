Font collection number.

Some font files are actually font collections (e.g. D-Type or TrueType Collections) which contain multiple fonts in the same file. Font collection number identifies a font in the font collection. Set the font collection number to 0 to open the first font in the collection. If this value is too large, the font will not open.
