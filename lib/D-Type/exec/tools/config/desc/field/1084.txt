This link supplies text layout attributes. When building the Text Design or Rich Text Design object, this is a link to the {a href="../objects/016.htm"}Text Layout (Manual){/a} object. When building any other text object, this is a link to the {a href="../objects/005.htm"}Text Layout (Automatic){/a} object.

Text Design and Rich Text Design utilize a manual text layout algorithm which means that the (x, y) position of each glyph/character must be supplied explicitly by the user. All other text objects utilize an automatic text layout algorithm which means that the position of their glyphs/characters is calculated automatically by the text layout engine while the user only supplies higher-level layout attributes such as direction, alignment, kerning, letter/row spacing etc.
