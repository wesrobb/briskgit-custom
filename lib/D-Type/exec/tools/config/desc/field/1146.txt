An array containing RGBT values of each contour (variable length, 4 bytes per contour). This property should be used when each contour in the polygon has a different RGBA value (colour and/or transparency). Additionally, the presence of this array is a signal to D-Type Power Engine to render the body of the polygon using D-Type Direct Color RGBA Rasterizer. This ensures the best possible output quality.
