Sets one of the hinting modes. The hinting mode tells the Typesetter how to interact with the pixel grid when rendering glyphs. See D-Type Standard Engine Manual for details.

{strong}Supported values:{/strong}

0 = Engine Default A (same as 8)

1 = Engine Default B (same as 9)

2 = User Default A (same as 4)

3 = User Default B (same as 6)

4 = X On, Y On
Both X and Y edges are snapped to the pixel grid. As a result, both X and Y edges look reasonably sharp.

5 = X On, Y Off
Only X edges are snapped to the pixel grid. As a result, X edges look reasonably sharp, while Y edges look somewhat blurry.

6 = X Off, Y On
Only Y edges are snapped to the pixel grid. As a result, X edges look somewhat blurry, while Y edges look reasonably sharp.

7 = X Off, Y Off
Neither X nor Y edges are snapped to the pixel grid. As a result, both X and Y edges look somewhat blurry.

8 = Auto A
Same as 4 for standard font sizes, but disables hinting in the X and/or Y direction for very small and very big font sizes. This is done in order to improve speed when rendering using very small and very big font sizes. This is a useful and recommended mode since hinting is not really necessary at those sizes.

9 = Auto B
Same as 6 for standard font sizes, but disables hinting in the Y direction for very small and very big font sizes. This is done in order to improve speed when rendering using very small and very big font sizes. This is a useful and recommended mode since hinting is not really necessary at those sizes.

All the above values are inherited from D-Type Standard Engine. See D-Type Standard Engine Manual for more details.
