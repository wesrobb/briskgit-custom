In general, this property represents the height of a line, shape or other object in document units. Most objects assume a positive height. But some objects (e.g. lines) can have either a positive or a negative height. In these cases, the height property also indicates the direction.

This property may also be used for some other more specific purposes. For example, in PowerFonts this property refers to the font's base height (or vertical units per em-square).
