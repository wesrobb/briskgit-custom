In general, this property represents the width of a line, shape or some other object in document units. Most objects assume a positive width. However, some objects (e.g. lines) can have either a positive or a negative width. In these cases, this property also indicates the direction.

This property may also be used for some other more specific purposes. For example, in PowerFonts it refers to the font's base width (or horizontal units per em-square). Similarly, in PowerFont records this property serves as the advance width of a glyph.
