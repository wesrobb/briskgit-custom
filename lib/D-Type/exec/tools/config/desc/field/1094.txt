Attributes of an object.

1) When used to build the {a href="../objects/013.htm"}Group Member{/a} object, this value should be interpreted as follows:

Bit 0 unset = indicates a visible PowerDoc object.
Bit 0 set = indicates a hidden PowerDoc object. Hidden object are not rendered.

Bit 2 unset = do not use fractional positioning for object origins.
Bit 2 set = use fractional positioning for object origins.

All other bits are reserved for future use and must be set to 0.

2) When used to build the {a href="../objects/134.htm"}System Guide{/a} object, the interpretation is different:

Bit 0 = If set, show right part of the guide
Bit 1 = If set, show bottom part of the guide
Bit 2 = If set, show left part of the guide
Bit 3 = If set, show top part of the guide
Bit 4 = If set, the right part is just a short segment, otherwise it is infinitely long
Bit 5 = If set, the bottom part is just a short segment, otherwise it is infinitely long
Bit 6 = If set, the left part is just a short segment, otherwise it is infinitely long
Bit 7 = If set, the top part is just a short segment, otherwise it is infinitely long
