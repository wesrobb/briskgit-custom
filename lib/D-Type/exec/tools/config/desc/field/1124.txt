Offset of 1st strike-through line from glyph's baseline.

The interpretation of the value depends on the specified Underline/Strike-Through Line Positioning Mode:

* Mode 0 - Automatic: This value is ignored and should be set to 0 or omitted.

* Mode 2 - Manual (% of font height): The offset is manually specified and represents the percentage of the font height, multiplied by 1024/100.

  Examples:

  -2048 = -200%
  -1024 = -100%
  -512 = -50%
  0 = 0%
  512 = 50%
  1024 = 100%
  2048 = 200%

* Mode 4 - Manual (document units): The offset is manually specified and represents the offset in document units, multiplied by 1024.

  Examples:

  -2048 = -2 doc units
  -1024 = -1 doc units
  -512 = -0.5  doc units
  0 = 0  doc units
  512 = 0.5  doc units
  1024 = 1 doc units
  2048 = 2 doc units
