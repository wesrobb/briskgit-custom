The distance, in bytes, between the beginning of two neighbouring pixel rows. This property makes it possible to pass to D-Type Power Engine bitmap images that have some padding (extra bytes) at the end of each bitmap row.

This property works with all supported Bitmap Image Data formats (pdImageDataGray, pdImageDataGrayAlpha, pdImageDataRGB, pdImageDataRGBAlpha) except pdImageDataMono.

A valid pitch value must not be less than pdNw * bytes_per_pixel, where bytes_per_pixel is 1 for pdImageDataGray, 2 for pdImageDataGrayAlpha, 3 for pdImageDataRGB and 4 for pdImageDataRGBAlpha. A pitch value that is exactly pdNw * bytes_per_pixel bytes indicates that the pixel rows are contiguous; in other words there are no extra bytes between the neighbouring pixel rows. A pitch value that is larger than pdNw * bytes_per_pixel bytes indicates that the pixel rows are non contiguous; in other words at the end of each row there are some extra bytes (the number of extra bytes is pdPitch - pdNw * bytes_per_pixel). Note that D-Type Power Engine does not read or use these extra bytes.

If pdPitch is not specified, D-Type Power Engine will use the value pdNw * bytes_per_pixel, i.e. assume that pixel rows are contiguous. If pdPitch is not properly defined, D-Type Power Engine will not be able to display the bitmap image.
