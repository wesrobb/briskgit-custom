Font underline and/or strike-through effect.

The first byte (bits 1-8) is used to specify the type of the underline and/or strike-through effect. Supported values are as follows:

0 (000 000) = No Effect
1 (000 001) = Underline
2 (000 010) = Double Underline
8 (001 000) = Strike-Through
9 (001 001) = Strike-Through and Underline
10 (001 010) = Strike-Through and Double Underline
16 (010 000) = Double Strike-Through
17 (010 001) = Double Strike-Through and Underline
18 (010 010) = Double Strike-Through and Double Underline

If the line definition for the underline and/or strike-through effect is supplied (via the pdUnderlinePtr link in Power Engine or TX_ATTR_UNDERLINE_THICKNESS attribute in Text Engine), then the second byte (bits 9-16) is used to specify the thickness of the secondary line in double underline and double strike-through effects relative to the primary line. The value itself is expressed in 1/255 increments of the thickness of the primary line. Value 0 is special and indicates a default thickness (which is set to 50% of the thickness of the primary line). The thickness of the primary line is supplied via the line definition and is expressed in 1/100 increments of document units..

Interpretation of the second byte when line definition is supplied:

0 = Default thickness (50% of the thickness of the primary line)
1 = 1/255 (or 0.39%) of the thickness of the primary line
2 = 2/255 (or 0.78%) of the thickness of the primary line
3 = 3/255 (or 1.17%) of the thickness of the primary line
...
253 = 253/255 (or 99.22%) of the thickness of the primary line
254 = 254/255 (or 99.61%) of the thickness of the primary line
255 = 255/255 (or 100%) of the thickness of the primary line

If the line definition for the underline and/or strike-through effect is not supplied (via the pdUnderlinePtr link in Power Engine or TX_ATTR_UNDERLINE_THICKNESS attribute in Text Engine), then the second byte (bits 9-16) is used to specify the thickness of both the primary and secondary line relative to the font height. The value itself is expressed in 1/255 increments of the font height. Value 0 is special and indicates a default thickness (which is set to 3.5% of the font height).

Interpretation of the second byte when line definition is not supplied:

0 = Default thickness (3.5% of the font height)
1 = 1/255 (or 0.39%) of the font height
2 = 2/255 (or 0.78%) of the font height
3 = 3/255 (or 1.17%) of the font height
...
253 = 253/255 (or 99.22%) of the font height
254 = 254/255 (or 99.61%) of the font height
255 = 255/255 (or 100%) of the font height

{strong}Sample values:{/strong}

3856 = Double strike-through whose primary line thickness is supplied via the line definition while the secondary line thickness is 15/255 (or 5.88%) of the primary line thickness

3856 = Double strike-through whose both primary and secondary line thickness is 15/255 (or 5.88%) of the font height
