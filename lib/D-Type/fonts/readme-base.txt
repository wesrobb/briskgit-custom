   AMSFonts PostScript Fonts (Adobe Type 1 format)

   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   The PostScript Type 1 implementation of the AMSFonts produced by and
   previously distributed by Blue Sky Research and Y&Y, Inc. are now freely
   available for general use. This has been accomplished through the cooperation
   of a consortium of scientific publishers with Blue Sky Research and Y&Y.
   Members of this consortium include:

   Elsevier Science IBM Corporation Society for Industrial and Applied
   Mathematics (SIAM) Springer-Verlag American Mathematical Society (AMS)

   In order to assure the authenticity of these fonts, copyright will be held by
   the American Mathematical Society. This is not meant to restrict in any way
   the legitimate use of the fonts, such as (but not limited to) electronic
   distribution of documents containing these fonts, inclusion of these fonts
   into other public domain or commercial font collections or computer
   applications, use of the outline data to create derivative fonts and/or
   faces, etc. However, the AMS does require that the AMS copyright notice be
   removed from any derivative versions of the fonts which have been altered in
   any way. In addition, to ensure the fidelity of TeX documents using Computer
   Modern fonts, Professor Donald Knuth, creator of the Computer Modern faces,
   has requested that any alterations which yield different font metrics be
   given a different name.

   The AMS does not provide technical support or installation assistance beyond
   any installation instructions included in this file. Installation and use of
   these fonts may require some technical expertise. Review this READ.ME file
   in its entirety before undertaking an installation.

   The canonical version of the PostScript AMSFonts is located on
   the AMS FTP server, ftp.ams.org, at /pub/tex/psfonts/amsfonts.

   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   History

   The PostScript versions of the AMSFonts were produced by Blue Sky Research
   of Portland, Oregon, and Y&Y, Inc., of Concord, Massachusetts, who published
   the fonts in conjunction with their commercial implementations of the TeX
   program.

   Character outlines were derived from high-resolution METAFONT-generated
   character bitmaps by the ScanLab application from Projective Solutions (Ian
   Morrison and Henry Pinkham), applied and corrected by Douglas Henderson of
   Blue Sky Research. Character hints were created by software from Y&Y
   (Berthold and Blenda Horn), with extensive hand work by Blenda Horn. Font
   engineering, production, and packaging were by Douglas Henderson and Berthold
   Horn.

   -----------------------------------------------------------------

   What changes were made between AMSFonts 2.1 and AMSFonts 2.2?

   The primary change is the inclusion of LaTeX support macro files as part of
   the AMSFonts distribution. The files in the "latex" subdirectory of this
   directory are compatible with LaTeX2e, the current LaTeX standard. Users of
   LaTeX 2.09 are strongly encouraged to upgrade to LaTeX2e, as we do not
   support the use of AMSFonts with LaTeX 2.09.

   The only significant change to the characters in the fonts was a bug fix
   which corrected an anomaly in the Blackboard Bold N character from the MSBM
   fonts. That character printed incorrectly at a few resolutions (including
   600dpi), and it now prints correctly at all resolutions. The metrics for
   AMSFonts 2.2 are not different from those for AMSFonts 2.1.

   There has also been a slight change to the file amssym.tex, and very
   significant changes to the User's Guide.

COPYRIGHT NOTICE AND LICENSE
----------------------------

   Hindsight Unicode © Starving-4 Entertainment. 2000, 2001. This font is
   licensed under the terms of the Design Science Licence:
   http://dsl.org/copyleft/dsl.txt


   DESIGN SCIENCE LICENSE

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

   Copyright © 1999-2001 Michael Stutz <stutz@dsl.org>
   Verbatim copying of this document is permitted, in any medium.

   0. PREAMBLE.

   Copyright law gives certain exclusive rights to the author of a work,
   including the rights to copy, modify and distribute the work (the
   "reproductive," "adaptative," and "distribution" rights).

   The idea of "copyleft" is to willfully revoke the exclusivity of those
   rights under certain terms and conditions, so that anyone can copy and
   distribute the work or properly attributed derivative works, while all
   copies remain under the same terms and conditions as the original.

   The intent of this license is to be a general "copyleft" that can be
   applied to any kind of work that has protection under copyright. This
   license states those certain conditions under which a work published
   under its terms may be copied, distributed, and modified.

   Whereas "design science" is a strategy for the development of
   artifacts as a way to reform the environment (not people) and
   subsequently improve the universal standard of living, this Design
   Science License was written and deployed as a strategy for promoting
   the progress of science and art through reform of the environment.

   1. DEFINITIONS.

   "License" shall mean this Design Science License. The License applies
   to any work which contains a notice placed by the work's copyright
   holder stating that it is published under the terms of this Design
   Science License.

   "Work" shall mean such an aforementioned work. The License also
   applies to the output of the Work, only if said output constitutes a
   "derivative work" of the licensed Work as defined by copyright law.

   "Object Form" shall mean an executable or performable form of the
   Work, being an embodiment of the Work in some tangible medium.

   "Source Data" shall mean the origin of the Object Form, being the
   entire, machine-readable, preferred form of the Work for copying and
   for human modification (usually the language, encoding or format in
   which composed or recorded by the Author); plus any accompanying
   files, scripts or other data necessary for installation, configuration
   or compilation of the Work.

   (Examples of "Source Data" include, but are not limited to, the
   following: if the Work is an image file composed and edited in PNG
   format, then the original PNG source file is the Source Data; if the
   Work is an MPEG 1.0 layer 3 digital audio recording made from a WAV
   format audio file recording of an analog source, then the original WAV
   file is the Source Data; if the Work was composed as an unformatted
   plaintext file, then that file is the Source Data; if the Work was
   composed in LaTeX, the LaTeX file(s) and any image files and/or custom
   macros necessary for compilation constitute the Source Data.)

   "Author" shall mean the copyright holder(s) of the Work.

   The individual licensees are referred to as "you."

   2. RIGHTS AND COPYRIGHT.

   The Work is copyrighted by the Author. All rights to the Work are
   reserved by the Author, except as specifically described below. This
   License describes the terms and conditions under which the Author
   permits you to copy, distribute and modify copies of the Work.

   In addition, you may refer to the Work, talk about it, and (as
   dictated by "fair use") quote from it, just as you would any
   copyrighted material under copyright law.

   Your right to operate, perform, read or otherwise interpret and/or
   execute the Work is unrestricted; however, you do so at your own risk,
   because the Work comes WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY -- see Section 7 ("NO
   WARRANTY") below.

   3. COPYING AND DISTRIBUTION.

   Permission is granted to distribute, publish or otherwise present
   verbatim copies of the entire Source Data of the Work, in any medium,
   provided that full copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty, where
   applicable, is conspicuously published on all copies, and a copy of
   this License is distributed along with the Work.

   Permission is granted to distribute, publish or otherwise present
   copies of the Object Form of the Work, in any medium, under the terms
   for distribution of Source Data above and also provided that one of
   the following additional conditions are met:

   (a) The Source Data is included in the same distribution, distributed
   under the terms of this License; or

   (b) A written offer is included with the distribution, valid for at
   least three years or for as long as the distribution is in print
   (whichever is longer), with a publicly-accessible address (such as a
   URL on the Internet) where, for a charge not greater than
   transportation and media costs, anyone may receive a copy of the
   Source Data of the Work distributed according to the section above; or

   (c) A third party's written offer for obtaining the Source Data at no
   cost, as described in paragraph (b) above, is included with the
   distribution. This option is valid only if you are a non-commercial
   party, and only if you received the Object Form of the Work along with
   such an offer.

   You may copy and distribute the Work either gratis or for a fee, and
   if desired, you may offer warranty protection for the Work.

   The aggregation of the Work with other works that are not based on the
   Work -- such as but not limited to inclusion in a publication,
   broadcast, compilation, or other media -- does not bring the other
   works in the scope of the License; nor does such aggregation void the
   terms of the License for the Work.

   4. MODIFICATION.

   Permission is granted to modify or sample from a copy of the Work,
   producing a derivative work, and to distribute the derivative work
   under the terms described in the section for distribution above,
   provided that the following terms are met:

   (a) The new, derivative work is published under the terms of this
   License.

   (b) The derivative work is given a new name, so that its name or title
   cannot be confused with the Work, or with a version of the Work, in
   any way.

   (c) Appropriate authorship credit is given: for the differences
   between the Work and the new derivative work, authorship is attributed
   to you, while the material sampled or used from the Work remains
   attributed to the original Author; appropriate notice must be included
   with the new work indicating the nature and the dates of any
   modifications of the Work made by you.

   5. NO RESTRICTIONS.

   You may not impose any further restrictions on the Work or any of its
   derivative works beyond those restrictions described in this License.

   6. ACCEPTANCE.

   Copying, distributing or modifying the Work (including but not limited
   to sampling from the Work in a new work) indicates acceptance of these
   terms. If you do not follow the terms of this License, any rights
   granted to you by the License are null and void. The copying,
   distribution or modification of the Work outside of the terms
   described in this License is expressly prohibited by law.

   If for any reason, conditions are imposed on you that forbid you to
   fulfill the conditions of this License, you may not copy, distribute
   or modify the Work at all.

   If any part of this License is found to be in conflict with the law,
   that part shall be interpreted in its broadest meaning consistent with
   the law, and no other parts of the License shall be affected.

   7. NO WARRANTY.

   THE WORK IS PROVIDED "AS IS," AND COMES WITH ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY,
   EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
   INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY
   OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

   8. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.

   IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHOR OR CONTRIBUTORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT,
   INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
   (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR
   SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION)
   HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,
   STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING
   IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THIS WORK, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
   POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.
