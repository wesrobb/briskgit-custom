# PROJECT STATE: SUSPENDED

I've stopped working on this since developing a UI from scratch with full unicode support is a ton of work. It is evident why people defer to browser engines for this (e.g. electron) or QT or just ignore complex text layout (Dear Imgui). Since this project is suspended I've decided to focus on building [briskgit]() using Dear ImGui instead.

## EVA

This project relies on a custom platform layer developed for UI applications called [eva](https://github.com/wesrobb/eva).

## Libraries
